## About this Blog

Welcome to my blog. I always wanted to learn code and new to programming in general, and planning to journal my journey as I learn just that.

## About me

Hi, I am Rafef Anam. I am currently a student in Jatya Kabi Kazi Nazrul University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh, studing Bangla Language and Literature. I am not a CS sutudent but I am learning to code regardless, as it's part of my hobby.
