I will try to keep this as brief as possible.

## Hour 1
I had everything set up beforhand. I am using a free tutorials from youtube.

So I wrote hello world, and couple of basic codes using variables.

I still can't add 2 files in a single project, cause it gives me an error about Main"()" function being used twice.
I hope I will find a workaround in future.

## Hour 2
Learned if _ else statemnet. 

Also solved a very basic problem called Watermelon on codeforce to practice

## End of the day ! 2 hours done and 498 hours remaining
