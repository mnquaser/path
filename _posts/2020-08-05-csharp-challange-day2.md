I will try to keep this as brief as possible.

I learned quite a few functions or modules, I kinda forget what they are called in c#.

Practice 3 problems in Codeforces, It was a decent practice. topics learned briefly, usage of array, list and some few other stuffs I can't really remember now. sorry I am kinda sleepy.

In average, 4 hours today.

## End of the day ! 6 hours done total and 494 hours remaining.
