## Hour 1 - 2

Learned :
	* Char
	* Methods and method callings
	* Math.Ceiling() and  Math.floor()
	
basically it sums up nearly all of the basics I had previously learned in python3

## Hour 3

Learned :
	* The usage of while-loop and do-while-loop.
	
Need to write some codes using these tomorrow. Updating my guessing game in c# at this point will be a great idea.

## End of the day ! 9 hours done and 491 hours remaining
